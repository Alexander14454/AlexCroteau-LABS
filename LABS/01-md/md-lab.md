**NOTE:**
Find the docs [here](https://realpython.com/).

It is super easy to learn and not at all hard to read. It uses a lot of plain words which makes it very easy to use and makes it even better for developers to read code. It also can run on any machine, which means it can be coded once and run anywhere. it is also open source which mean it can be changed to your liking, it also has a  wide range of add-ons/**modules.**

<h2>Why is python so good</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open source</li>
<li>Thousands of modules/add-ons</li>
<li>Millions of python sources</li>
<li>Easy to understand</li>
</ol>

Quote from creater of python: 
> Don't you hate code that's not properly indented? Making it [indenting] part of the syntax guarantees that all code is properly indented.
